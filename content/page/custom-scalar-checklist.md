# How to improve your schema with Custom Scalars

## What

Use Custom Scalars instead of GraphQL primitives.

Instead of:

```graphql
type Book {
  publicationDate: String!
  priceInCents: Int!

  # cover assets are stored at
  # `/covers/<coverImage>?format=<large|small>`
  coverImage: String!

  averageRating: Float!
  id: String!
}
```

Try using Custom Scalars like this:

```graphql
type Book {
  publicationDate: DateTime!
  price: USD!
  coverImage: CoverImage!
  averageRating: StarRating!
  id: BookId!
}
```

## When

- You want to transform the value into a particular data structure (e.g. Custom Scalar `DateTime` -> Elm `Time`)
- You want to ensure that a value is not mixed up and passed in where it has the same primitive representation but different semantic meaning (for example, `ProductId` and `UserId` might both be Strings, but if they are Custom Scalars then `elm-graphql` can prevent you from passing in the wrong type.
- You want to control _how_ the data is used. For example a `Temperature` or `USD` Custom Scalar has implementation details (perhaps `USD` is represented in cents, but you don't want to leak that knowledge all over your codebase, you want to keep it in one central location).

## Why

**Custom Scalars are a way of representing a contract.**

For example, a `DateTime` is just a `String` under the hood. But there is a contract. When I call a value a `DateTime`, I am promising that you will always be able to parse it as an ISO-8601 String (or however it is represented in your API).

The data in your GraphQL response will actually be the same. But by using the `DateTime` Custom Scalar, you are telling `elm-graphql` that it is safe to use it in a specific way. In this case, it may be that it can parse it as an ISO-8601 String.

Some other examples would be representing Currency (perhaps `USD`). Again, the underlying representative is just a GraphQL primitive, but you've now given it semantic meaning. And `elm-graphql` is able to take this semantic meaning and turn it into a specific type.

## Custom Scalars for Ids

GraphQL provides a type called `Id`. I recommend ignoring this type and instead creating a Custom Scalar to represent each type of Id in your domain. For example `ProductId` or `UserId`.

Why bother?

- Nice clear information in the documentation for free
- Elm can prevent you from passing in a `UserId` where the API requires a `ProductId`

## Custom Scalars as Gate Keepers

Custom Scalars also provide a pinch point that allows you to limit all the knowledge about how to use a certain type to a single place. For example, you can use an Opaque Type to make sure that the only way `USD` is displayed is by asking the `USD.elm` module to display it for you. This gives you confidence that the knowledge of how to turn the underlying data representation for `USD` is not leaked throughout your codebase, which reduces bugs and makes it easier to reason about your code.

If you're not using the Custom Scalar Codecs functionality in `elm-graphql`. Take a look at the official [Custom Scalar Codecs example and instructions](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/blob/master/examples/src/Example07CustomCodecs.elm).

Here's an example illustrating this with `USD`.

```elm
module USD exposing (USD, codec, toString)


import Graphql.Codec exposing (Codec)
import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder)
import Json.Encode


type USD
    = Dollars Int


codec : Codec USD
codec =
    { encoder = encode
    , decoder = decoder
    }


decoder : Decoder USD
decoder =
    Json.Decode.map Dollars Json.Decode.int


encode : USD -> Json.Encode.Value
encode (Dollars  dollars) =
    Json.Encode.int dollars


toString : USD -> String
toString (Dollars  dollars ) =
    "$" ++ String.fromInt dollars
```
