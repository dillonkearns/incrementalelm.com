# `elm-ts-interop` init Command, Codec and Pipeline APIs, and docs site

This week I have some improvements to announce for `elm-ts-interop`. In particular, I've been focused on making it easier to get started with the free Community Edition. And I've also shipped some new APIs for building up your type-safe Encoders and Decoders.

If you're not familiar with `elm-ts-interop`, it's a tool that generates TypeScript types from your custom JSON Decoders and Encoders to ensure that the types are in sync between your Elm app and TypeScript code. If you're not using TypeScript in your project, you can even benefit from the improved type-safety using vanilla JavaScript by using JSDoc comments ([[typescript-without-transpilation]]).

You can learn more about [How elm-ts-interop works](https://elm-ts-interop.com/how-it-works) and find some [learning resources](https://elm-ts-interop.com/resources).

## elm-ts-interop Community Edition Setup Guide

You can find the newly published docs which inclue a [thorough walkthrough for how to get started with `elm-ts-interop`](https://elm-ts-interop.com/setup). To make it easier to get set up, I've also added an `elm-ts-interop init` command that will scaffold the two Elm files you need to get started. Try it out and let me know how it goes!

## Codec and Pipeline APIs

The [`elm-ts-json`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-ts-json/latest/) Elm package is the secret sauce for getting type information from your Decoders and Encoders. The core API remains the same, but version 2.0 of the package now comes with a `Codec` API (thank you miniBill for the great API design!) as well as a port of the [`NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline/latest/) API. The Codec API also includes a new addition from miniBill's Codec API for customizing the names of fields (rather than having custom types encoded as an Array of positional values). Check out the new [`TsJson.Codec` API](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-ts-json/latest/TsJson-Codec) and [`TsJson.Pipeline` API](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-ts-json/latest/TsJson-Decode-Pipeline).

As always, feel free to ask me questions on Twitter [@dillontkearns](https://twitter.com/dillontkearns), or on Slack (we have an [#elm-ts-interop channel](https://elmlang.slack.com/archives/C01ST485YAU)). Happy type-safe coding!
