Today I'm announcing [a new course on `elm-ts-interop` fundamentals and setup instructions](/courses/elm-ts-interop). This is a free course, and it focuses on the Community Edition of `elm-ts-interop`, plus a chapter on the differences between the Community and Pro Editions. It includes some detailed examples, explanations, and exercises. I even created a small command-line tool ([`ellie-app-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ellie-app)) to let you instantly open and run the interactive exercises with your favorite editor in your local environment. You can try it out on one of the exercises from the `elm-ts-interop` course:

```shell
npm install -g elm-live elm-json ellie-app && ellie-app fQWYRPSQxvsa1
```

I'm working on some paid Elm courses, so stay tuned for those. My goal is to produce quality content that explores techniques for making Elm applications more maintainable, as well as some tutorials on Elm libraries that go beyond the basics. I hope this will be a valuable resource for Elm devs looking to dive deeper, and I also hope it can help support my continued work on open source projects like `elm-pages`, `elm-graphql`, `elm-markdown`, and other efforts in my mission to make the Elm ecosystem as vibrant as possible.

If you have any feedback on this course, or anything you'd like to see in future courses, I'd love to hear your thoughts!
