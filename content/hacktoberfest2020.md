# Hacktoberfest Kickoff and Panel Discussion

With all the postponed Elm events this year, I'm excited to share a live community event. Hacktoberfest! We have an great panel discussion lined up with guests Aaron VonderHaar, Harry Sarson, Matt Griffith, and Ian Mackenzie. And we'll have Q & A sessions about 3 open source projects by their project maintainers Keith Lazuka, Jeroen Engels, and me (Dillon Kearns).

Sign up for free and [see the event details on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/elm-hacktoberfest-kickoff-and-panel-discussion-tickets-123112317255).

## When

Saturday, October 3 at 9am Pacific (12pm Eastern).

## What

The kickoff event will feature:

- A panel discussion about Elm Open Source, with Aaron VonderHaar, Harry Sarson, Matt Griffith, and Ian Mackenzie
- Introduction to Elm Hacktoberfest and some contribution opportunities
- Question and answer sessions on `intellij-elm` (with Keith Lazuka), `elm-review` (with Jeroen Engels), and `dillonkearns/elm-markdown`.
- Open discussions with other attendees

### What is Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is an open invitation to open up 4 pull requests to public open source projects between October 1 - 31. It's a fun event that gets the community involved in some open source projects, and welcomes them into the process with some helpful mentoring and curated GitHub issues.

We'll walk through some issues, and discuss how to get started with these projects at the kickoff event on Saturday.

You can learn more about Hacktoberfest at the official site: <https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details>.

## Where

To view the kick off event, join the [Incremental Elm Community Discord](/chat). We have a community of people in that server who are working towards improving the Elm Open Source ecosystem. It's been a really positive and supportive environment, and anyone who is willing to follow the [community code of conduct](/code-of-conduct) is very welcome!

Why not YouTube, Twitch, Zoom, etc.? Hacktoberfest is all about community, and Discord has proven to be a great place to share progress and collaborate on open source work, all with a supportive environment. I also think that the way people engage takes many different forms, and I want a medium that supports that. For example, some people really like asynchronous chats. You can chat to your hearts content and skip out on video streams if you like.

Some people like to lurk, or send one-on-one messages. This space is great for that as well! Or if you want to hang out in a video chat room in case anyone wants to pop in and say hello, our Discord is great for that as well!
